    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li> pound spaghetti</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol><li><h3>Step 1</h3>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>

            <li><h3>Step 2</h3>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li></ol>
